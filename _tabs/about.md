Hi, I'm Fabio and I'm an Italian high school student. Welcome to my blog.

I enjoy **programming, IT and all things tech**. I'm the proud owner of a small homelab (aka an HP office PC that I like to pretend is a server) on which I run lots of cool services and applications. I'm also very interested in **space and astronomy** and I'm involved in several projects with ASI, the Italian Space Agency.

Another area I'm particularly interested in is politics and activism. I'm part of *Rete degli Studenti Medi* (lit. "Average Students' Network"), the largest student union in the country, and I'm active in student government bodies such as the Rome Provincial Assembly.

This blog will be my little corner of the internet where I'll just post random stuff about the things I'm doing in my life. When I'm not doing something related to the above, I'm probably either at the gym, listening to music or reading a book. Or, of course, writing this blog.

I decided to start this blog because I felt the need to organise and unpack all the things that are happening around me. It could have been a personal diary, but where's the fun in that? It'll be pretty much the same as no one will read it, but eh... there you go.

One last thing: you might ask yourself, "why choose a .uk domain if you're Italian? The reason is simple. It was the cheapest domain I could buy on Cloudflare. 20â‚¬ for a 5 year domain is a bargain.

This page may be updated from time to time as I start writing, so you might want to check back from time to time.

And feel free to follow me on Twitter (I am refusing to call it X on ethical grounds), you can find the link at the bottom of the page. You'll also find my email there.
