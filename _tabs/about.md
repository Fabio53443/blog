Hi, I'm Fabio and I'm an Italian high school student. Welcome to my blog.

I enjoy **programming, IT and all things tech**. I'm the proud owner of a small homelab (aka an HP office PC that I like to pretend is a server) on which I run lots of cool services and applications. I'm also very interested in **space and astronomy** and I'm involved in several projects with ASI, the Italian Space Agency.

Another area I'm particularly interested in is politics and activism. I'm part of *Rete degli Studenti Medi* (lit. "Average Students' Network"), the largest student union in the country, and I'm active in student government bodies such as the Rome Provincial Assembly.

This blog will be my little corner of the internet where I'll just post random stuff about the things I'm doing in my life. When I'm not doing something related to the above, I'm probably either at the gym, listening to music or reading a book. Or, of course, writing this blog.

I decided to start this blog because I felt the need to organise and unpack all the things that are happening around me. It could have been a personal diary, but where's the fun in that? It'll be pretty much the same as no one will read it, but eh... there you go.



## Why the name?

I was looking around some fun names and came up with *TheseusCodes*. The name refers to the myth/dilemma of Theseus' ship: is an object the sum of its parts? If all the parts change, gradually, is it the same object it was? Who knows. But when I look at some of my code I have the feeling of working on a strange Frankenstein's monster of code from other projects. Hence, Theseus' Codes. 

I actually wanted "Theseus.code" as my domain but ".code" appears not to be a TLD. I therefore registered "theseus.codes" thanks to the Github Student Pack. I then realised that it would only be free for a year and they wanted like 50€ to renew it. No thanks. that's how I ended up with .uk. *Why* .uk specifically, you may be asking yourself: simply put, it was the cheapest. 20€ for a 5 year domain is a bargain.
